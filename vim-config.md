# Configuration for your vim to make it enjoyable.

## In as much as we try to make this beginner friendly it's not really for beginneer as they are many technical things that go into ii.

## Please try and least know how to navigate your way in vim.

### Please make sure you already have vim install if not usee the commands `pkg install vim-nox -y` for termux and `apt-get install vim-nox` for your linux machine and if you are not the super user use `sudo apt-get install vim-nox`

### After installing vim you need to go to your home directory `cd ~`.

### Create a file with the name .vimrc `touch .vimrc`.

### You need to edit the content of the file you can use anyway you want but for me the most convinent is to use vim to use vim run the command `vim .vimrc`.

### Inside the file you you can just put in the edit you need but I'm going to do Two(2), with hopes you how it works

### Insert `:set number` to make sure anytime you use vim you will always see the line numbers.

### In the next line insert `:syntax on` to turn on syntax coloring.

### please follow me on github as i will be adding in some basic configuration to this and also check out my ubuntu installation for termux.
