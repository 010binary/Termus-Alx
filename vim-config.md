## In as much as we try to make this beginner friendly it's not really for beginneer as they are many technical things that go into it

### please make sure you already have vim install if not usee the commands `pkg install vim-nox -y` for termux and `apt-get install vim-nox` for your linux machine and if you are not the super user use `sudo apt-get install vim-nox`
